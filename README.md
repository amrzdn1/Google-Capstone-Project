# Google Capstone Project: Bike Data Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for my completion of the Google Capstone project focusing on bike data analysis. The project involved utilizing SQL for data manipulation and analysis, as well as Power BI for creating interactive dashboards to visualize insights.

## Project Objectives

- Analyze a large dataset containing bike usage data.
- Extract insights and trends surrounding bike usage patterns.
- Utilize SQL for efficient data querying and manipulation.
- Create visually compelling dashboards using Power BI to communicate findings effectively.

## Technologies Used

- SQL: Used for data manipulation, querying, and analysis.
- Power BI: Utilized to create interactive dashboards for visualizing insights.
- GitHub: Repository hosting and version control.

## Project Structure

- **data**: Contains the dataset used for analysis.
- **sql_queries**: SQL queries used for data manipulation and analysis.
- **power_bi**: Power BI files for creating visual dashboards.
- **README.md**: This file providing an overview of the project.

## Getting Started

To replicate or explore the analysis:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `sql_queries` directory to access the SQL scripts.
3. Use your preferred SQL client to run the queries on the provided dataset.
4. Navigate to the `power_bi` directory to access the Power BI files.
5. Open the Power BI files to explore the visual dashboards.
